    <p><em><b>Daleela</b> is my first child</em></p>
    <p>Daleela was born on July 4th 2022 at 3:42pm. Georgetown,Guyana in Balwant singh hospital.
      She weighed 7.7lbs her hair is very beautiful and curly.
      She's growing so fast myself and <em><strong>Marsena</strong></em> are so amazed to be her parents.
      We have so much planned for Deleela's future. We manifest greatness for our baby.
      This is why I am learning to code. I want to show her, Marsena and myself that i can be an asset
      to them and the world not only as a husband and father. As tech is continuing to advance the world.
      I am determined apart of history as tech changes consistly </p></td>
